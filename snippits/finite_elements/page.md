# Finite Element Methods (FEM)

FEM is one of the essential building blocks of our modern society.
Without it we cannot predict how complex structures will behave or fail due to loading.
Some prominent examples of where FEM shines is in the automotive-, aerospace- and biomedical engineering fields.
In all these fields it is costly and/or dangerous to test and develop prototypes.
FEM allows us to predict (up to some level of confidence) what the behavior of such prototypes might be.
