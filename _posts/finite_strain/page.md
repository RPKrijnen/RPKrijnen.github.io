# Finite strain

Here is some generic info on finite strain theory

$$  
    \boldsymbol{F} = \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{x}}{\partial \boldsymbol{X}} 
$$  

Here is some text in between

$$
    \Psi = a(I_{1}-3)^2
$$

Here is an inline equation test: $\boldsymbol{P} = \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial \boldsymbol{F}}$

Here is another test using the `\begin{equation}` command:

$$\begin{equation}
    I_{1} = tr\left( \boldsymbol{C}\right)
\end{equation}$$
